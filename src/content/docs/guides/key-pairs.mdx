title: Key Pairs (Public & Private Keys)
description: Understand and create RSA key pairs for YoMemo—zero-trust local generation vs. quick online generation, and how to upload your public key.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

YoMemo uses **RSA key pairs** for end-to-end encryption: your **private key** stays on your device to decrypt data and sign it; your **public key** is sent to the server so it can verify signatures and associate ciphertext with you. The server never sees your private key and cannot decrypt your memories.

## Why the server needs your public key

- The server stores only **encrypted** data and your **public key**.
- The public key is used to **verify** that incoming encrypted packages were signed by the matching private key.
- Without a registered public key, the server cannot accept your encrypted memories.

If you generate the key pair **locally**, you must **upload the public key once** (see [Upload your public key (local key only)](#upload-your-public-key-local-key-only) below). If you generate it **in the YoMemo dashboard**, the public key is registered for you automatically.

## Recommendation

<Aside type="tip" title="Zero-trust recommendation">
We recommend **zero-trust**: create your key pair **locally** (Option B) so the private key never leaves your machine and your data stays fully under your control. Use **cloud generation** (Option A) only when you want to try the product quickly.
</Aside>

## Option A: Generate online (quick try)

You can generate a key pair in the YoMemo dashboard and download the PEM file directly. Use this only for a quick try; for production or sensitive data, prefer Option B.

1. Log in to [YoMemoAI](https://api.yomemo.ai) → **Settings** → **Public Key**.
2. Click **Generate Key Pair** (or equivalent). The public key is registered automatically; download and save the **private key** PEM file (e.g. `private.pem`).

## Option B: Generate locally (OpenSSL) — recommended

Generate the key pair on your machine. The private key never leaves your device; maximum security.

```bash
# Using OpenSSL
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```

<Aside type="caution">
Keep your private key secure! Never share it or commit it to version control. If you lose it, you cannot recover your encrypted data.
</Aside>

## Upload your public key (local key only)

If you used **Option B** (local OpenSSL), you must upload your public key to YoMemo once. The server expects the **Base64-encoded RSA modulus** (not the full PEM). If you used Option A, skip this section.

1. Log in to [YoMemoAI](https://api.yomemo.ai) → **Settings** → **Public Key**.
2. Click **Manually Update Public Key**.
3. Get the public key in the required format from the directory containing `private.pem`:

   **macOS / Linux (OpenSSL + xxd):**

   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in private.pem -noout -modulus \
     | sed 's/Modulus=//' | xxd -r -p | base64
   ```

   **Any platform (Python 3 with `cryptography`):**

   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

   Then run (from the directory containing `private.pem`):

   ```python
   python3 -c "
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import (
       load_pem_private_key,
   )
   from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
   import base64

   with open('private.pem', 'rb') as f:
       k = load_pem_private_key(f.read(), None, default_backend())
   n = k.public_key().public_numbers().n
   byte_len = (n.bit_length() + 7) // 8
   print(base64.b64encode(n.to_bytes(byte_len, 'big')).decode())
   "
   ```

4. Paste the single-line Base64 string into the dialog and click **Update Public Key**.

<Aside type="caution">
Without this step, the server cannot verify your encrypted memories and MCP (or other client) operations will fail. You only need to do this once per key pair.
