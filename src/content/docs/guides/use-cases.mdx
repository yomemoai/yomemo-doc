import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

YoMemo provides a **Zero-Knowledge** memory layer for AI applications. By utilizing **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**, every piece of data is encrypted locally with the user's private key before it ever reaches our servers. Even we cannot read your memories.

## Why Secure Memory Matters

| Feature | Standard Vector DBs | YoMemo (E2EE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Visibility** | Service providers can access plaintext | **Only you hold the decryption key** |
| **Training Risk** | Data may be used for model training | **Mathematically impossible to leak to LLMs** |
| **Security** | Vulnerable to server-side breaches | **Zero-Knowledge architecture** |

## 1. Privacy-First AI Personalization
Empower AI assistants with deep personal context without compromising user privacy. Since data is decrypted only on the client side, users can store sensitive habits and preferences securely.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Sovereign User Profiles" icon="setting">
    Store work styles, communication tones, and personal routines. 
    
    **Examples:**
    - Internal coding standards and private library references.
    - Sensitive daily schedules and productivity peaks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cross-Session Privacy" icon="puzzle">
    Maintain context across different platforms. Your "Memory" follows you, but remains invisible to the infrastructure providers.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Example: Remembering Preferences Securely
```typescript
// Data is encrypted on the client before being sent to YoMemo
await yoMemo.save({
  content: "I use a custom internal framework 'X-Lib' for all my React components.",
  handle: "dev-preferences",
  tags: ["private", "coding"]
});

```

## 2. Secure Credential & Secret Storage

YoMemo acts as a secure vault for secrets that your AI agents need to perform tasks.

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Encrypted Secret Management" icon="forward-slash">
Store API keys, database strings, and SSH credentials. AI agents can access these only within your trusted execution environment.
</Card>

<Card title="Zero-Trust Access" icon="key">
Provide AI with the keys to your development environment without ever exposing them in plaintext on the cloud.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="danger" title="Privacy Guarantee">
YoMemo uses AES-256-GCM encryption. Your private key never leaves your device. If you lose your key, even we cannot recover your data.
</Aside>

## 3. Confidential Project Context

Keep your intellectual property safe. Store project architectures and business logic that you don't want leaked into public LLM training sets.

<CardGrid>
<Card title="IP Protection" icon="rocket">
Store proprietary algorithms, unreleased product roadmaps, and internal system designs.
</Card>

<Card title="Team Knowledge Vault" icon="puzzle">
Share encrypted project memories across a team where only authorized members hold the decryption keys.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

### Example: Storing Proprietary Logic (Go)

```go
// Using Go SDK - Encryption happens in the background
err := client.Add(ctx, memo.AddOpts{
    Content:     "Our core valuation logic uses the formula: [Proprietary Formula]",
    Handle:      "core-ip",
    Description: "Confidential Business Logic",
    Metadata: map[string]string{
        "classification": "highly-confidential",
    },
})

```

## 4. Personal "Zero-Knowledge" Second Brain

Build a knowledge base of your most private thoughts, research, and learning notes.

* **Unpublished Research:** Store hypotheses and data findings securely.
* **Private Journaling:** Use AI to reflect on personal growth with total privacy.
* **Sensitive Templates:** Store custom prompts that contain sensitive business logic.

## Long-Term Secure Conversation Memory

Enable AI assistants to remember important information across months or years, protected by hardware-level security.

**Scenario: Secure Long-term Collaboration**

```text
User: "Remember the server architecture we discussed for the 'Phoenix' project."

AI: [Retrieves encrypted memo 'phoenix-arch' -> Decrypts locally]
AI: "Yes, Project Phoenix uses a sharded PostgreSQL cluster with a custom 
    Go-based middleware. Would you like to review the migration steps?"

```
