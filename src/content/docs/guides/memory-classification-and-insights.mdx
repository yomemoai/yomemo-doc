When you save memories through MCP (or other integrations), YoMemo does not only store encrypted content. We attach a **semantic fingerprint** to each memory so you can understand and balance your knowledge base over time. This page introduces the classification system and the direction we are building toward.

## How we classify memories

For each saved memory, we use the following dimensions to organize and surface insights:

### E/L/A/P radar

Every memory can be scored on four axes (0–1 each), stored in the memory’s **semantic fingerprint**:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|
| **E — Emotion** | Subjective mood or feeling in the content |
| **L — Logic** | Technical density and factual derivation |
| **A — Abstraction** | Philosophical depth and underlying patterns |
| **P — Pragmatism** | Actionability and execution value |

These scores are optional metadata (e.g. provided by the AI when it calls `save_memory`). In the YoMemo dashboard, **Pro** users can see an **E/L/A/P radar** that aggregates these scores across memories, so you can see at a glance whether your base is skewed toward emotion, logic, abstraction, or pragmatism—and adjust how you record things if you want more balance.

### Handle distribution

Memories are grouped by **handle** (e.g. `work`, `personal`, `project-x`). The dashboard shows how many memories you have per handle. This helps you see which areas of your life or work are most represented and avoid overloading a single handle.

### Memory spectrum

A visual spectrum of your memories (e.g. one tile per memory, colored by Emotion: cool = low, warm = high) gives a quick picture of the “temperature” and variety of your stored content. Gray tiles indicate memories without ELAP data.

### Capacity & balance tips

As your memory base grows, we surface simple **capacity and balance suggestions**, for example:

- Too many memories in total — consider archiving or consolidating.
- Too many handles — consider merging or renaming.
- Strong bias toward logic (L) or emotion (E) — optional nudge to add more of the other.

These tips are designed to keep your memory graph useful and readable, not to restrict you.

  The full **Insights** experience (E/L/A/P radar, handle distribution, memory spectrum, and balance tips) is available in the YoMemo dashboard for **Pro** users. The same semantic fingerprint data can be used by other clients or the API if you build your own tools.

## Long-term and short-term memory (roadmap)

Today, every memory is stored in one encrypted pool. As the product and your usage grow, we plan to **gradually introduce long-term and short-term memory**:

- **Short-term** — Recent or frequently accessed items, or items you mark as ephemeral; easier to surface in daily use and optionally to expire or demote.
- **Long-term** — Core knowledge and decisions you want to keep and reuse over years.

Memories will continue to be encrypted and under your control. The goal is to make the system **continuously improve your life**: the right information at the right time, without clutter, and with a clear view of how your knowledge is balanced (E/L/A/P, handles, spectrum) and how it evolves.

## Summary

| Concept | Role |
|--------|------|
| **E/L/A/P radar** | Classify and visualize each memory on Emotion, Logic, Abstraction, Pragmatism (0–1). |
| **Handle distribution** | See how memories are spread across handles; avoid overload. |
| **Memory spectrum** | Visual overview of variety (e.g. by Emotion). |
| **Capacity & balance tips** | Light suggestions to keep the base healthy. |
| **Long-term / short-term (planned)** | Gradually expose different retention and surfacing for different kinds of memory. |

Saving via MCP (with optional `metadata.semantic_fingerprint`) feeds this system; the dashboard and future features use it to help you understand and grow your memory in a way that **continuously improves your life**.
