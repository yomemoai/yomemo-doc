YoMemo provides a secure, encrypted memory layer for your AI applications. The easiest way to get started is using the **Python MCP integration**, which enables AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to save and retrieve encrypted memories seamlessly.

## Why YoMemo?

## Quick Start with Python MCP

The Python MCP integration is the recommended way to get started, especially if you're using AI assistants like Claude Desktop or Cursor.

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Install the MCP Server</h3>
      Use `uvx` to run the MCP server directly (no installation needed):
      
      ```bash
      uvx yomemoai-mcp --help
      ```
      
      Or install via `pip`:
      
      ```bash
      pip install yomemoai-mcp
      ```
      
      <Aside type="tip">
        `uvx` is recommended as it automatically handles dependencies and doesn't require a global installation.
      </Aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Get Your API Key</h3>
      Sign up at [YoMemoAI](https://yomemo.ai) to get your API key. You'll need this to authenticate with the service.
      
      <Aside type="caution">
        Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.
      </Aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Generate Your RSA Key Pair</h3>
      You need an RSA private key for encryption. Generate one if you don't have it:
      
      ```bash
      # Using OpenSSL
      openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
      ```
      
      Or use the Go SDK to generate one programmatically (see [Go SDK Integration](/integrations/go-sdk/)).
      
      <Aside type="caution">
        **Critical**: Keep your private key secure! Never share it or commit it to version control. If you lose it, you cannot recover your encrypted data. The server only stores your public key and cannot decrypt your memories.
      </Aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Configure Your MCP Client</h3>
      Add the MCP server configuration to your AI assistant. The configuration location depends on your tool:
      
      <h4>For Cursor</h4>
      Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\mcp.json` on Windows):
      
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "yomemoai": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["yomemoai-mcp"],
            "env": {
              "MEMO_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
              "MEMO_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/private.pem",
              "MEMO_BASE_URL": "https://api.yomemo.ai"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      
      <h4>For Claude Desktop</h4>
      Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):
      
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "yomemoai": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["yomemoai-mcp"],
            "env": {
              "MEMO_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
              "MEMO_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/private.pem",
              "MEMO_BASE_URL": "https://api.yomemo.ai"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      
      <Aside type="note">
        Replace `/absolute/path/to/private.pem` with the **absolute path** to your private key file. On Windows, use forward slashes (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/private.pem`).
      </Aside>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Restart Your AI Assistant</h3>
      After saving the configuration, restart Cursor or Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Start Using YoMemo</h3>
      Once configured, you can use YoMemo in your AI assistant conversations:
      
      **Save a memory:**
      ```
      "Please remember that my coffee machine password is 8888, with handle 'passwords'"
      ```
      
      **Retrieve memories:**
      ```
      "Can you recall my passwords?"
      ```
      
      **Organize with handles:**
      ```
      "Remember this project detail with handle 'project-alpha'"
      ```
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>

## How It Works

When you ask your AI assistant to save a memory:

1. **Encryption**: The MCP server encrypts your content using your local private key (AES-GCM + RSA-OAEP)
2. **Signing**: The encrypted data is signed for integrity verification
3. **Storage**: Only the encrypted ciphertext is sent to the YoMemo server
4. **Privacy**: The server cannot decrypt your data - it only stores encrypted content and your public key

When you ask your AI assistant to recall a memory:

1. **Retrieval**: The MCP server fetches encrypted data from YoMemo
2. **Decryption**: Your content is decrypted locally using your private key
3. **Delivery**: The plaintext is returned to your AI assistant

<Aside type="tip">
  The entire encryption/decryption process happens on your local machine. The YoMemo server never sees your plaintext data.
</Aside>

## Available MCP Tools

### `save_memory`

Store important information, user preferences, or conversation context. When you use the same `idempotent_key` with the same `handle`, the existing memory is updated (upsert) instead of creating a duplicate.

**Parameters:**
- `content` (required): The information to be remembered
- `handle` (optional): A category or tag (e.g., 'work', 'personal', 'project-x'). Defaults to 'general'
- `description` (optional): A brief summary
- `idempotent_key` (optional): A stable key for upsert. If a memory with the same (handle, idempotent_key) already exists, it is updated; otherwise a new memory is created. Use for project progress, habit tracking, or avoiding duplicate memories.

### `load_memories`

Retrieve previously stored memories.

**Parameters:**
- `handle` (optional): Filter by category. If not specified, returns all memories

## Other Integration Options

While Python MCP is the easiest way to get started, YoMemo also supports other integration methods:

- **[Official Client](/integrations/official-client/)**: Free desktop and mobile app (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) with the same encryption as MCP—manage memories in a GUI with a local lock.
- **[Go SDK](/integrations/go-sdk/)**: For programmatic access in Go applications
- **[REST API](/api/reference)**: Direct HTTP API access for any language

## Security Best Practices

- ✅ **Keep your private key secure**: Store it with file permissions `600` (read/write for owner only)
- ✅ **Never commit secrets**: Add `.env` files and private keys to `.gitignore`
- ✅ **Use environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in code
- ✅ **Backup your private key**: If you lose it, you cannot recover your encrypted data
- ✅ **Use strong keys**: Generate 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA keys

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Starting

1. Verify your `MEMO_API_KEY` is correct
2. Check that the private key path is absolute and the file exists
3. Ensure the private key file has correct permissions (recommended: `600`)
4. Test locally to see error messages:

   ```bash
   MEMO_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
   MEMO_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/path/to/private.pem" \
   uvx yomemoai-mcp
   ```

### Connection Issues

- Verify `MEMO_BASE_URL` is correct (default: `https://api.yomemo.ai`)
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure your API key is valid
