The Memo SDK uses a **hybrid encryption approach** that combines both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Understanding the difference between these two types of encryption helps explain why this approach is both secure and efficient.

## Symmetric Encryption

**Symmetric encryption** uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

### Characteristics

- ✅ **Same key** used for both encryption and decryption
- ✅ **Fast**, suitable for encrypting large amounts of data
- ⚠️ **Key needs secure transmission** (this is why we use RSA to encrypt the AES key)

### Example: AES

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the most common symmetric encryption algorithm:

```go
// AES symmetric encryption
aesKey := generateKey()           // Same key
cipherData := aes.Encrypt(data, aesKey)  // Encrypt with key
plainData := aes.Decrypt(cipherData, aesKey)  // Decrypt with same key
```

### Common Symmetric Algorithms

- **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) - Used by Memo SDK
- DES, 3DES
- ChaCha20

## Asymmetric Encryption

**Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.

### Characteristics

- ✅ **Public and private keys** are a pair, different purposes
- ✅ **Public key encrypts**, private key decrypts
- ✅ **Private key signs**, public key verifies
- ⚠️ **Slow**, not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data

### Example: RSA

RSA is the most common asymmetric encryption algorithm:

```go
// RSA asymmetric encryption
publicKey, privateKey := generateKeyPair()  // A key pair
cipherData := rsa.Encrypt(data, publicKey)   // Encrypt with public key
plainData := rsa.Decrypt(cipherData, privateKey)  // Decrypt with private key
```

### Common Asymmetric Algorithms

- **RSA** - Used by Memo SDK
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- ElGamal

## Comparison

| Feature                  | Symmetric (AES)                          | Asymmetric (RSA)                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed                     | ✅ Very fast                             | ⚠️ Slow (100-1000x slower than AES)                |
| Key Management            | ⚠️ Need secure key transmission          | ✅ Public key can be public                         |
| Data Size Limit           | ✅ Unlimited                             | ⚠️ Limited (2048-bit key can only encrypt 245 bytes) |
| Use Case                  | Encrypt large data                       | Encrypt small data, key exchange, signing           |
| Key Distribution          | ⚠️ Challenging                           | ✅ Easy (public key can be shared)                  |

## Why Use Hybrid Encryption?

The Memo SDK uses **hybrid encryption** to combine the best of both worlds:

Hybrid encryption uses symmetric encryption for data (fast) and asymmetric encryption for the key (secure key exchange).
</Aside>

### Hybrid Encryption Advantages

1. **Use AES (symmetric)** to encrypt large data → Fast
2. **Use RSA (asymmetric)** to encrypt AES key → Solves key transmission problem
3. **Combines both advantages**: secure and efficient

### How It Works in Memo SDK

```go
// 1. Generate AES key (symmetric encryption)
aesKey := make([]byte, 32)  // Same key for encryption and decryption

// 2. Encrypt data with AES (symmetric encryption)
cipherData := aes.Encrypt(data, aesKey)

// 3. Encrypt AES key with RSA public key (asymmetric encryption)
encryptedKey := rsa.Encrypt(aesKey, publicKey)

// Decryption:
// 1. Decrypt AES key with RSA private key (asymmetric decryption)
aesKey := rsa.Decrypt(encryptedKey, privateKey)

// 2. Decrypt data with AES key (symmetric decryption)
data := aes.Decrypt(cipherData, aesKey)
```

## Summary

- **Symmetric encryption (AES)**: Fast, efficient for large data, but requires secure key distribution
- **Asymmetric encryption (RSA)**: Solves key distribution problem, but slow for large data
- **Hybrid encryption**: Best of both worlds - fast data encryption with secure key exchange
