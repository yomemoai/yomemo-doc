### End-to-End Encryption (Pro)

For sensitive applications, you can provide your own encryption key. When enabled:

1. Data is encrypted on the client side (or your server) before reaching our API.
2. We store only the encrypted blobs.
3. **We cannot read your users' memories.**

### Admin Logs

Every API call is logged with:

- Timestamp
- Token usage
- Latency
- Extraction confidence score
